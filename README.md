# Awaab’s Law data model

> **Updated:** 27 June 2025

## About this project

The Awaab's Law data model allows you to record, track and respond to health and safety issues caused by damp and mould in social-rented homes.

This is a proof of concept for a data standard designed to support compliance with Awaab’s Law regulations, due to be introduced in October 2025\.

It was developed by the social housing data team at [Local Digital](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/) (a team within the [UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-local-government)) in partnership with:

* [TPXimpact](https://www.tpximpact.com/)  
* [Data Futurists](https://www.datafuturists.co.uk/)  
* [Housing Associations Charitable Trust (HACT)](https://hact.org.uk/)
