For contiguous/connected buildings, identification of where Property boundaries lie can be determined by considering the following: (i) if the users of the building have a specific name for it - for example 'North Tower', then it should be considered a separate Property even if it is physically connected to another Property at lower levels (and the low-level connecting structures are likely to be considered their own, separate Property); (ii) a Property is a physical description of space that is composed of a number of floors that - for the most part - are arranged one on top of the other (i.e. each floor is completely or largely overlapping the floor below). Properties also usually allow containment to be determined - someone or something should be either 'in' or 'out' of the Property.
