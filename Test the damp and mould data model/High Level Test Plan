# Awaab’s Law Data Model Test Plan

## 1. Create Dummy Data

Create several scenarios that test all different options.

### Forms Involved:
- Hazard Report form  
- Investigation form

## 2. Database Setup

- Create the database and run the SQL code to create tables.
- Insert dummy data into code lists and tables that should be prepopulated.

### Tables to Prepopulate:
- Property  
- Tenant  
- Household member  
- Any other already known information  

> **Note:** Code lists can be included in the provided SQL code.

## 3. Data Ingestion

### From Hazard Report Form:
- Map standard fields to DB table fields.
- Include logic to determine investigation type and dates.
- Query to determine tenant and household members of the property with a vulnerability (person alert code).
- Add logic to compare the hazard raised with the list of vulnerabilities and determine the correct investigation type.

### From Investigation Form:
- Map fields to DB tables.

## 4. Work Order Process

- Step through each stage of data.
- Ensure fields are populated and data makes sense.
- Note any steps that require additional fields not currently available.

## 5. What to Check

- At each stage of the mock process, assess whether there are fields that aren't used.
- Flag unused fields for review:
  - Why haven’t they been used?
  - Would they be used in a different scenario?
- Confirm whether the code lists fulfill requirements by providing all possible options.

## 6. Notes

- Check whether a schedule table/entity would be preferred.
- Test where an escalation would arise from.
- Determine if an escalation owner is needed.
- Test via Excel.
